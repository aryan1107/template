    <p>Since it was the last assignment, Professor wanted something interesting which she could take home. I decided to give her this showpiece. Intro to 3d modelling was my favourite subject that semester, and I learned many new things. It had to be small since we can only use the printer for 2 hours continuously(in college). So something which could be printed at that time would be good. I was inspired by 3DS Max topology options, so I created a star and added topology.
