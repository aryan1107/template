      <p>Was very new for 3DS Max, and our first assignment was to create a breakfast scene. Took me a few days to develop it. Still, in the end, my work was well appreciated by Professor, and later, she also sent this scene to be showcased in the Seneca College portfolio. Getting my
         work sent to our official college portfolio was another happy moment for me since only a few people get this chance.
