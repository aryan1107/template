    <p>A virtual reality game made using Unity. After all the skills I learned in my class, I decided to make something. I created a Virtual Reality Experience. To create a VR experience, I could choose any task. I decided to go with changing truck tier task. The player must remove a flat tire and replace it with a new one. Yes, all was done for Virtual Reality; later on, I also learned to export the unity file as an application for my mobile device and run on it. The example above shows how the application looks on a smartphone.

    <p> Below is a scene from the project; I have used free assets from an asset store to create a sci-fi environment. However, I used other stuff which I learned like lightmapping, material designs for walls, script to pick an object in VR and animations. A video shows the demo of the app itself.</p>
